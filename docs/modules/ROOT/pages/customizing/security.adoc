= Security and permissions

== Default permissions
By default, access to the administration interface is restricted to users having the *access administration* permission.
The allowed permissions can be specified by setting the *adminWebModule.access-permissions* property.

== Remember me configuration
You can easily enable remember me support for the administration ui by setting the correct properties.  By default
the `TokenBasedRememberMeServices` are used, meaning the user password is encoded into the cookie value.  When using a
local memory database during development this can be unhandy when users get reinstalled upon application start.  If
the user password is also encoded using a random encoder (the default when using the `UserModule`) the remember me
cookies will not work after a restart.  The solution for this to configure either a `NoOpPasswordEncoder.getInstance()`
or a fixed password encoder in local development mode.
