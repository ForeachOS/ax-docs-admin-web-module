= Admin Web

AdminWebModule provides infrastructure for building an secured administration section in your site.
All `@AdminWebController` beans will be mapped behind the admin web root path and will have the security rules applied.

Unless otherwise specified, the default admin web template will be applied for those controllers.
The default template is built on Bootstrap and JQuery and builds a menu structure that controllers can hook into via the `AdminMenuEvent`.
